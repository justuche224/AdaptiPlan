# **App Name**: AdaptiPlan

## Core Features:

- Smart Task Decomposition: AI-powered task breakdown: Converts vague tasks into actionable sub-tasks with estimated durations, adapting to the user's mood. Uses an LLM as a tool to incorporate specific details as required.
- Interactive Scheduling: Dynamic visual timeboxing: Automatically arranges sub-tasks into a drag-and-drop visual timeline, showing suggested breaks.
- Intelligent Schedule Adjustment: Automatic empathetic replanning: Offers non-judgmental rescheduling options when tasks are missed or delayed. The LLM acts as a tool which is invoked conditionally based on changes in task status.
- Personalized Adaptation: Quick check-in adjusts task durations/difficulty. Updates the tone of encouraging messages to suit user mood.
- Supportive Reminders: Sends gentle reminders and encouragement.
- Simplified View: Simplifies the UI to display one simple task at a time.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#D0B8FF), offering a calming and supportive feel suitable for users with ADHD.
- Background color: AMOLED Black (#000000), for maximum contrast and battery saving on AMOLED screens.
- Accent color: Gentle sky blue (#A0D2EB), an analogous hue adding a touch of vibrancy for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clear readability. A modern sans-serif gives an objective, neutral look for body text and titles alike.
- Use calming icons related to daily routines, using soft, rounded shapes and filled style to give the impression of friendliness.
- The timeline will use clear lines and blocks to visually separate the tasks, preventing visual clutter that might overwhelm some users.
- Animations should be subtle. For example, smoothly fade in/out interface elements.
